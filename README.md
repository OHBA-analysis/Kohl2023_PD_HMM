# Sensorimotor-Network-Dynamics-in-PD
Scripts for "Sensorimotor network dynamics changed in resting-state MEG recordings of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Patients" manuscript.


## Requirements

Preprocessing and TDE-HMMs were run in MATLAB 2020a using the following Toolboxes:  
    - [OSL](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/osl-docs)        
    - [HMM-Mar Toolbox](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR)
    
Calulations of State-Specific Spectra, Burst Analysis, and Statistics calculated in Python:  
    - all scripts can be run in the combined osl & osl-dynamics environment.  
      Instructions for the environment set up can be found [here](https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/osl-dynamics#installing-within-an-osl-environment).
